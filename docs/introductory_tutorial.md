The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the basic operations possible with Rucio, within a containerised environment.
Installation instructions for the required software can be found in the [Preliminaries](https://github.com/rucio/k8s-tutorial#preliminaries) and [Installation of Rucio + FTS + Storage](https://github.com/rucio/k8s-tutorial#installation-of-rucio--fts--storage) sections of the README.md in [this](https://github.com/rucio/k8s-tutorial) Github repository.
Below this, within the [Rucio Usage](https://github.com/Daniel-Jenkins/k8s-tutorial#rucio-usage) section, there are examples of commands with explanations, which will cover the basic usage of Rucio.
